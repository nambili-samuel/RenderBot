The San people (or Bushmen) are an indigenous hunter-gatherer group, one of the world's oldest momadic people with roots dating back to 100,000 years.

Primarily living in Botswana, Namibia, and surrounding nations.

The term "San" is a Khoekhoe term, but themselves they prefer to be identified as !Kung or Ju/'hoansi.

🌅 *Traditionally nomadic.*

What's your favorite Namibia story? Share with us!""",

            """📖 *The Etosha National Park Tour*

Etosha National Park is a national park near the town of Tsumeb in Namibia and one of the largest national parks in Africa.

The salt pans are the most noticeable geological features in the national park. This park is a great opportunity to view a diverse range of animal and birds that Africa is known for, including the Big 5: Lion, Leopard, Rhinoceros (black and white), Elephant and Buffalo.

No reservation costs, book your best lodges in Etosha at Mushara Lodge, Ongava Lodge, Mokuti Lodge, Halali Camp, and many others."

🐘 *Nature finds a way, always.*

Have you seen Namibia's desert elephants?""",

            """📖 *The Story of the Himba People*

The Himba have lived in northern Namibia for centuries, maintaining traditions in a modern world.

Their signature red ochre paste isn't just beauty—it's protection from the harsh desert sun. Each hairstyle tells a story: marital status, age, social position.

They're semi-nomadic pastoralists, moving with their cattle, reading the land, respecting nature. When development came, they chose to preserve their culture while embracing useful technology.

👥 *Tradition and progress can walk together.*

What traditions do you value?""",

            """🏖️ *Swakopmund: Where Desert Meets Ocean*

Swakopmund is both a quiet retreat and a wild experience. Simultaneously a city of timelessness and a starting point for your wildest dreams."

Swakopmund is like a mirage between two worlds. On one side, the endless Namib Desert, shimmering under the sun like living gold.

If you’re looking for something even crazier, try sandboarding in Dune 7. From nearby Walvis Bay, cruises set off, taking you amidst playful dolphins and curious seals. You might even see a pelican joining the boat directly in search of fish.

*The Little Wonders of Namib Desert.*
